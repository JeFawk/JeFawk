# Hi, I'm JeFawk! 👨‍💻🍝  

🎮 Game dev, coder, and creative chaos generator from Romania 🇷🇴. Along with my amazing waifa **[Frostnight](https://fni.art)** 🎨🖋️—an incredible artist and writer, we create Smol Spaghettorium 🧠🍝. Smol Spaghettorium is our chaotic-creative hub where we mix games, art, writing, apps, stickers, and more, into a massive mess of passion projects.
Me personally? I've been crafting games, building worlds, and smashed my CTRL+C CTRL+V keys for nearly 15 years (? 🤔). Freelancing full-time (mostly working on my own pasta projects) while being fueled by coffee ☕ and wild-dumb ideas 💡.  

## What I Do  
- 🎮 **Games**: multiplayer whatevers, RPGs, branching stories, and lore-filled worlds, some simple, some unnecessarily complex.  
- 🛠️ **Code**: Game engines, tools, apps—if it's code, I'm in.  
- 🌌 **Random Projects**: Art prints, stickers, devlogs, bad music 🎶, horrible vids, and more.  
- 🔧 **Gamedev Tools**: Rarely, but I make tools to help devs.  
- 🖥️ **Open Source**: A little, when time allows.
